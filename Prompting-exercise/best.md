# Best Prompt Example

## Prompt

> Convert the `moving_average` Python function in `test.py` to Java with the following requirements:
> - Implement as a `public static` method in a Java class named `MovingAverageCalculator`.
> - The method should take a `List<Double>` and an `int` for window size, and return a `List<Double>` representing the moving averages.
> - Include input validation to throw exceptions for invalid window sizes, matching the Python logic.
> - Add JavaDoc comments and inline comments explaining key steps.
> - Provide a complete example in a `main` method that demonstrates usage and prints the result.
> - Use clear and beginner-friendly Java best practices.

## Why This is Best: The Four Pillars

- **Context:**  
  Points to the specific Python function in `test.py`, and describes the translation scenario in detail.

- **Intent:**  
  Clearly states the outcome: a reusable, well-documented, easy-to-learn Java class and method that mirrors the Python logic.

- **Clarity:**  
  Outlines every expectation: method signature, error handling, documentation, code comments, and a complete working example.

- **Specificity:**  
  Defines the class name, argument and return types, exception handling, and requires both JavaDoc and inline comments, ensuring that Copilot delivers code suitable for learning, production, or review.
