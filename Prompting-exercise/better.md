# Better Prompt Example

## Prompt

> Convert the `moving_average` Python function in `test.py` to an equivalent Java method.  
> Make sure the method is inside a class and handles input validation like the original. Include example usage.

## What You Might Get from Copilot

Copilot is more likely to generate:
- A Java class containing a static method for moving average calculation
- Basic input validation for window size

## Why This is Good: The Four Pillars

- **Context:**  
  The prompt specifies the exact Python function (`moving_average` in `test.py`) to convert, giving Copilot a clear starting point and source material.

- **Intent:**  
  The request communicates the purpose—convert the function, preserve input validation, and provide example usage—so Copilot knows the expected outcome.

- **Clarity:**  
  Instructions are direct: place the method inside a class, include input validation, and add usage. This removes ambiguity about what the final Java code should include.

- **Specificity:**  
  The prompt details which features to implement (input validation, example usage) and where to find the original code, increasing the likelihood of a correct and complete translation.
